<!-- In order for the program to work properly, locate the folders inside node_modules, and place the folders titled "atl-js-code", and "circletype", inside the node_modules folder inside the ATL-AngularCLI-Angel. This is a quick work around while I fix the nod_modules in the angular project.

In addition, you must install bootstrap, jquery, and popper on the project.

You do this by going to the terminal, cd into the project folder, and run:

      npm install bootstrap --save
      npm install jquery --save
      npm install popper.js --save

You must also modify the script and styles in the angular-cli.json file.

Unless you made any additional changes yourself, the included angular-cli.json in this repo should look exactly like the angular-cli.json on the atl-angluarcli-angel project. The code below is what I am referring to in the angular-cli.json file:

  "styles": [
    "../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css",
    "styles.css"
  ],
  "scripts": [
    "../node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.slim.js",
    "../node_modules/popper.js/dist/umd/popper.js",
    "../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.js",
    "../node_modules/circletype/circletype.min.js",
    "../node_modules/atl-js-code/splash.js"
  ],

After that, everything should be work ing just fine! -->
